* ancilla.el: Your AI Coding Assistant

Enhance your coding experience with code generation, rewriting, and interactive discussions.

** Demo

[[./demo.gif]]

** Feature Highlights

- Generate code at the cursor with instructions
- Rewrite the selected region with instructions
- Discuss selected code (not implemented yet)
- AI understands the full context displayed on the screen
  + AI sees the visible part of the current buffer, not just the selected region
  + Inspect the raw conversation in the =*ancilla-chat*= buffer
- Review diffs before applying rewrites (can be disabled with the =ancilla-show-confirmation= customization)
- Asynchronous requests (can be disabled with the =ancilla-async= customization)

The architecture is designed to support any AI backends. Currently, only the =chat= adaptor is implemented, which utilizes OpenAI's chat completion (ChatGPT and GPT4 supported).

** Installation

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package ancilla
  :straight (:host github :repo "shouya/ancilla.el")

  ;; ancilla-generate-or-rewrite calls ancilla-generate or
  ;; ancilla-rewrite depending on whether there is an active
  ;; selection.
  :bind ("C-x C-r" . ancilla-generate-or-rewrite)

  :custom
  ;; Defaults to gpt-3.5-turbo, you can opt to use gpt-4.
  ;; (ancilla-adaptor-chat-model "gpt-4")
  (ancilla-adaptor-chat-openai-api-key "sk-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"))
